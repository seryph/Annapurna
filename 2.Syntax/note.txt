How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" or "yarn install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" or "yarn start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.
